# zoohackathon project - San Diego, CA

## overview
This is an Interagency Deconfliction Applcation that creates a simple, secure, yet profoundly effective centralized deconfliction portal for distributing counter-poaching efforts. This app has administrator provided credentials, upon which given will allow users to enter locations and associated activities along with an expiration time. These searches will input the information into a deployed mySQL database and return if there are any conflicting entries made by other agencies. If there are overlapping activities(i.e two agencies working in the same area/or similar activity) a notification will be provided and contact information to the conflicting agency will be returned to the user.
